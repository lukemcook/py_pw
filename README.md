A simple password generator written in Python. 

It will ask the user for the desired password length and then generate a complex password using a pre-defined list of characters with randomness. Has input handling functionality and after the password is generated it will be copied to the system's clipboard.

Most websites/systems will reject passwords that are too short, so I have a set minumum of 5 characters.
